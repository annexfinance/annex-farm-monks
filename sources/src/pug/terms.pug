                | SwipeSwap is a forked codebase of Uniswap and SushiSwap, which is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that people can use to create liquidity and trade ERC-20 and BEP-20 tokens. There are two versions of the SwipeSwap protocol (Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain), each of which is made up of free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains. Your use of the SwipeSwap protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses while digital assets are being supplied to the SwipeSwap protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool. Before using the SwipeSwap protocol, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the SwipeSwap protocol works. Additionally, just as you can access email email protocols such as SMTP through multiple email clients, you can access the SwipeSwap protocol through multiple web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand the fees and risks they present.

Upgrades and modifications to the protocol are managed in a community-driven way by holders of the SXP governance token. No developer or entity involved in creating the SwipeSwap protocol will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the SwipeSwap protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value. SwipeSwap is not available in the United States or any OFAC restricted country.
